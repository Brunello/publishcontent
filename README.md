publishcontent
==============

####Creates granular publish/unpublish permissions in Drupal without granting Administer Nodes permission.####

Patched version of the Drupal "[Publish Content](http://drupal.org/project/publishcontent)"
contrib module by [malaussene](http://drupal.org/user/79249).

See [#1913638](http://drupal.org/node/1913638#comment-7050506) for the D6 
backport issue and [#899656](http://drupal.org/node/899656) fo the original
issue.

This patch has already been rolled into the D& Dev version of the module. So if
you're using D7, just use the dev version found on the [publichcontent module page](http://drupal.org/project/publishcontent).
